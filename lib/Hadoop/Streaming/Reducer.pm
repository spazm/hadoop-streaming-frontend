# ABSTRACT: Simplify writing Hadoop Streaming jobs. Write a reduce() function and let this role handle the Stream interface.  This Reducer roll provides an iterator over the multiple values for a given key.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    package WordCount::Reducer;
    use Any::Moose;
    with qw/Hadoop::Streaming::Reducer/;

    sub reduce {
        my ($self, $key, $values) = @_;

        my $count = 0;
        while ( $values->has_next ) {
            $count++;
            $values->next;
        }

        $self->emit( $key => $count );
    }

    package main;
    WordCount::Reducer->run;

Your mapper class must implement map($key,$value) and your reducer must 
implement reduce($key,$value).  Your classes will have emit() and run() 
methods added via the role.

=method run

    Package->run();

This method starts the Hadoop::Streaming::Reducer instance.  

After creating a new object instance, it reads from STDIN and calls $object->reduce( ) passing in the key and an iterator of values for that key.

Subclasses need only implement reduce() to produce a complete Hadoop Streaming compatible reducer.

sub run {
    my $class = shift;

    my $input = Hadoop::Streaming::Reducer::Input->new(handle => \*STDIN);

    while ($iter->has_next) {
        my ($key, $values_iter) = $iter->next or last;
        eval {
            $self->reduce( $key => $values_iter );
        };

            warn $@;
